# CSN150 – ESP32-CAM Email Intrusion Detection System

## Project Overview
This project was developed for the CSN150 Cybersecurity course. It demonstrates a basic physical intrusion detection system using an ESP32-CAM microcontroller. When motion is detected, the device captures an image and sends it to the user via email as a security alert.

This project focuses on defensive cybersecurity principles such as monitoring, alerting, and security awareness using low-cost IoT hardware.

## Cybersecurity Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide real-time awareness of unauthorized physical access to a protected area. From a cybersecurity perspective, it acts as a lightweight intrusion detection and alerting system.

---

## Problem It Solves
Many people do not have access to expensive security cameras or monitoring systems. This project provides an affordable solution that can:
- Detect motion
- Capture visual evidence
- Send alerts remotely via email

---

## Security Functions Performed
- Physical intrusion detection
- Image capture for evidence
- Email-based alerting
- Continuous monitoring of a protected space

---

## Hardware Used
- ESP32-CAM (AI Thinker / ESP32-CAM-MB)
- OV2640 Camera Module
- USB connection to PC

---

## Software Used
